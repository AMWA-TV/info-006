This Implementation Guide aims to present implementers with a launchpad to propel their MS-05 / IS-12 / BCP-008 implementations quickly off the ground.

The guide targets the following specifications:

- [MS-05-01 NMOS Control Architecture](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-01)
- [MS-05-02 NMOS Control Framework](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-02)
- [AMWA IS-12 NMOS Control Protocol](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-12)
- [AMWA BCP-008-01 NMOS Receiver Status](https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-008-01)
- [AMWA BCP-008-02 NMOS Sender Status](https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-008-02)

Guidance sections will include links to relevant sections of these specifications.

This guide also assumes some previous familiarity with two existing NMOS specifications:

- [AMWA IS-04 NMOS Discovery and Registration](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-04)
- [AMWA IS-05 NMOS Device Connection Management](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-05)

The following resources will be used in later sections of this guide:

- [NMOS Device control mock](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-device-control-mock)
- [Browser WebSocket extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/websocket)

A comprehensive testing tool is available in the form of the [NMOS API Testing Tool](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-testing).

An open source media node framework is available in the form of [nmos-cpp](https://github.com/sony/nmos-cpp).
