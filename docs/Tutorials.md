This Implementation Guide aims to present implementers with a launchpad to propel their MS-05 / IS-12 implementations quickly off the ground.

Target specifications:

- [MS-05-01 NMOS Control Architecture](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-01)
- [MS-05-02 NMOS Control Framework](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-02)
- [MS-05-03 NMOS Control Block Specifications](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-03)
- [AMWA IS-12 NMOS Control Protocol](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-12)

`Note:` This guide assumes some previous familiarity with two existing NMOS specifications:

- [AMWA IS-04 NMOS Discovery and Registration](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-04)
- [AMWA IS-05 NMOS Device Connection Management](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-05)

Resources:

- [NMOS Device control mock](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-device-control-mock)
- [Browser WebSocket extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/websocket)
